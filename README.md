# Society Management System

Apartment culture is very common in small, medium or big cities where various 
amenities, like theatre, swimming pool, game zone, banquet hall, gym, etc. have been 
shared among many people. Generally, societies are having the flats between 100 to 
600 and around 300 to 1800 people in the society can be expected. Two types of 
credentials are expected: Society members (president, secretory, treasure, etc.) and 
flat holders. Amenity booking, payment gateway, budget analysis, circulators/notice, 
records, and security features are expected in the application. Also we can have 
services booking like electrician, plumbing, Carpenter, Ac repairing, gardening and 
internet services.
